# Attribute declarations
#

# All types used for devices.
# On change, update CHECK_FC_ASSERT_ATTRS
# in tools/checkfc.c
attribute dev_type;

# All types used for processes.
attribute domain;

# Temporary attribute used for migrating permissions out of domain.
# Motivation: Domain is overly permissive. Start removing permissions
# from domain and assign them to the domain_deprecated attribute.
# Domain_deprecated and domain can initially be assigned to all
# domains. The goal is to not assign domain_deprecated to new domains
# and to start removing domain_deprecated where it's not required or
# reassigning the appropriate permissions to the inheriting domain
# when necessary.
