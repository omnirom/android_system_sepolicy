# - You failed to setcon u:r:init:s0 in your init.rc and thus your init
#   program was left in the kernel domain and is now trying to execute
#   some other program.  Fix your init.rc file.
# - You are running an exploit which switched to the init task credentials
#   and is then trying to exec a shell or other program.  You lose!
